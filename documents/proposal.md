# Proposal

## Summary
I would like to create a "portfolio" that show utilizes responsive design and
advanced CSS elements to showcase personally curated music selections (albums, artists, playlist, mixtapes).

## APIs
* [Apple Music API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi)
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
* (Potentially)[Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide)

## Objectives
* I've personally found that the experiencing of sharing music on the Internet via a single "centralized" URL is frustrating given that each service (Apple Music, Spotify, Soundcloud) is siloed.
* Consequently, I hope to create a site that allows me share content in a single place, and allows the visitor to playback the content on whichever streaming platform they prefer (I understand this means I will do the lift of creating duplicate selections, such as a playlist, across the platforms).
* My hope is that this will also provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses across the different platforms' APIs.
* By choosing a subject matter as graphical and flexible as music, I anticipate that it will provide many opportunities to experiment with layout, navigation, and visual presentation.
